A proposal to add dinosaur codepoints to Unicode

This is a not fully serious proposal for dinosaurs as Unicode codepoints. We're open to pull requests!

What we need
------------

* Examples in the wild, where dinosaur shapes are used as glyph/character. Look for emerging readers' books!
* Prose on why this is a must-have (use-cases)
* A working font
* Useful suggestions about block name, code points, ...
 
When do we need it?
-------------------

**NOW!** The deadline is April 1, 2014.

Other ressources
----------------

* Look at http://unicodepowersymbol.com/ ([Github](https://github.com/jloughry/Unicode)) how they did it.
